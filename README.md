## Crypocurrency Index
Sustainable cyrpo currencies exist but are not widely known.  Creating an idex of sustainable and atruistic cryptos could encourage investment.
This repository concerns itself with scraping market history and creating an index to be used for CrowdDoing's crypto team to build an index dashboard. <br>
The `Generic_Scrape_Module` is used to collect data. <br>
The `CoinMarketCap_Index_Module` uses said data and formulates an index based on those results. <br>
`CrowdDoing_Sustainability_Index` is an early attempt and serves as the basis for the final modules, it should not be used in production.<br>
